## Install

```bash
npm i @juicyllama/nestjs-recurly
```

## Usage

1a. Add your API key to your .env if running a single-recurly account with key `RECURLY_API_KEY`
1b. Pass your recurly API key with each request (this takes priority) if running a single or multiple recurly accounts.
2. Integrate your NestJS application with the relevant modules (e.g. endpoints) required

You can checkout the [Sandbox](./src/sandbox/) for an example implementation.

## Types

We have typed each resource type and have exported them for your use. 

You can import them into your code and reuse them.

## Testing

We are using a sandbox account to run all tests locally and in our CI/CD. If you want to run the test suite, you should create an sandbox account with recurly.

### Limitations

Standard accounts don't come with features:

* account_hierarchy
* external_resource_tracking

Therefore some tests have been disabled
