# Project Overview

This project is an abstracted NestJS module designed to simplify the integration of Recurly API into various applications. It provides a set of utilities and services that allow developers to easily manage subscriptions and billing without dealing with the complexities of API requests and response handling.

## Libraries and Frameworks

- NestJS - https://docs.nestjs.com/ 
- Recurly API - https://recurly.com/developers/api/v2021-02-25/

## Important Considerations

- Always use NestJS documentation for guidance on module creation and service injection.
- If using a single Recurly API key, it should be securely stored and accessed through environment variables.
